<!--
Modules work only via HTTP(s), not locally
If you try to open a web-page locally, via file:// protocol,
you’ll find that import/export directives don’t work.
Use a local web-server, such as static-server or use the
“live server” capability of your editor, such as VS Code Live Server Extension to test modules.
